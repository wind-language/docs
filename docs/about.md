# About Wind & Me

## Who am I?

I am an high school student who loves programming and low-level stuff. I started programming when I was 10 and I have been learning and experimenting with different programming languages and technologies since then. I am passionate about systems programming, compilers, and operating systems.

I've been working on Wind for a while now and I'm excited to share it with the world, as I am writing this Wind is still in its early stages and already 200Kb of code. I am working on it every day and I am excited to see where it goes.

## Why Wind?

Wind is a programming language that I created to learn more about compilers and low-level programming. I wanted to build a language that is simple, efficient, and gives full control to the programmer. Wind is designed to be minimalistic, fast, and easy to use while providing modern features and safety guarantees.

I believe that Wind has the potential to be a great language for systems programming, embedded development, and high-performance applications. I am excited to see how the community will use Wind and what amazing projects they will build with it.

## Contributing

Wind is an open-source project and I welcome contributions from the community.

I am always looking for feedback, suggestions, and ideas to make Wind better. If you have any thoughts or questions about Wind, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am excited to hear from you and work together to make Wind the best it can be.

### Needed Contributions

- **Compiler error reporting**:

    The error reporting in the compiler is not very good, I would like to improve it by adding more detailed error messages and suggestions for how to fix them. The best way to do this would be including a Token in every AST node and then using that token to get the line and column of the error.


- **Documentation**:
    
    Help improve the Wind documentation by adding examples, tutorials, and guides.

- **Testing**:
    
    Test Wind on different platforms and report any issues or bugs you encounter.


- **Feature Requests**:
    
    Share your ideas for new features or improvements to Wind.
